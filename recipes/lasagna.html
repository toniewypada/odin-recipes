    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking
        dish with cooking spray.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and
        cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat on medium-high. Saute
        onion and garlic for 3 minutes, or until onion is tender-crisp. Stir in
        broth and rosemary; bring to a boil. Stir in artichoke hearts and
        spinach; reduce heat, cover and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spread 1/4 of the artichoke mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking
        dish; top with 3 cooked noodles. Sprinkle 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese over
        noodles. Repeat layers 2 more times, ending with artichoke mixture and
        mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle crumbled feta on top.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake, covered, for 40 minutes. Uncover, and bake 15 minutes more, or
        until hot and bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
